# Deep_Augmentations

## Description

The aim of this project is to develope computational Deep Learning methods to infer species identity and phenology at the level of individual trees from time series of drone images by
leveraging Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Remote Sensing technologies to enhance our understanding of ecosystems and biodiversity.
